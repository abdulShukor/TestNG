Right click convert to testing, you can have multiple test case in one class
Suite->test folder(module)->classes->class
classNama.packagename, suite can have multiple module 
@beforeTest,@afterTest-> scope is folder level, good for deleting cookies 
@AfterSuite->@beforeSuite scope is entire xml form, good for URL and environment variable 
@beforeMethod->afterMethod is scope to the test case 
@beforeTest and @beforesuite is belong to xml file
@BeforeClass scope to the class level 
testing order in alphabetic order of method name 
smoke test two-way, unique name with regular expression or make them group 
one common value across all test case or global environment 
parameter-> (only applicable to test level) you can pass multiple value, global specific and test level specific. Constant. like URL 
Method specific is independent of xml specific to test case
Depend Onmethod can depend on multiple method or test case separate by, 
@dataProvider you can pass combination value like credential with array 
You can run test cases from xml and testing, if you have xml dependence then you cannot run from testNG  
Timeout = 4000l
You can active listener after and before test, good for failing result it is an interface separate class 
Assertion is good for validation 
For generating report test-output folder -> index.xml -> copy the path and past in a browser 
be smart on test, suite level 


Global environment 
Global variable keeps changing, like URL therefore you need for that global parameter which is common to all classes test cases.
It is possible with java property class 
Then create file with extension properties 
In file write password = “abdul”
Key value pair 
Fileinputstream is about path 
Two ways to sue the method of class, initiate the class, inheritance or in case interface 
Reusable component makes in base then reuse it, make everything global and dynamic 
Do not hard code and thing
